# Xtrem TDD escape game
This game is played in teams. 
Sit around a table and distribute the cards face down without revealing them or laying them out.
We highly recommend you to use `mob programming` during the whole game.

## Principle
As soon as you see a number (or a letter) on a card, you have the right to look for the matching card in the deck and turn it over to read it.

> Attention point: some numbers may be hidden!!!!

## Discarding cards
At the top of some cards you may find numbers and/or letters that are `crossed out`, you have to immediately `remove` these cards from the game by putting them `aside`.

## Material
